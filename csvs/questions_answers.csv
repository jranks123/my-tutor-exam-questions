"For a named megacity explain two disadvantages of informal employment (4)",4,"One disadvantage in Rio, Brazil, is the fact that the informal economy means that no taxes are paid. This means that less money is available to spend on services such as schools for the local population."
"For a named megacity explain two disadvantages of informal employment (4)",4,"One disadvantage in Rio, Brazil, is the fact that the informal economy means that no taxes are paid. This means that less money is available to spend on services such as schools for the local population. There is also a problem with job security, as there is no guarantee that informal jobs will continue and there is no pension or sick pay so people lack security."
"For a named megacity explain two disadvantages of informal employment (4)",4,"One issue is that people don’t know if they will get their next pay check. If their work is not guaranteed and they dont have a salary, they may not get paid the next month in informal jobs. Another reasons is that these jobs dont contribute to the economy as much. People dont pay taxes in informal jobs and dont pay as much."
"For a named megacity explain two disadvantages of informal employment (4)",4,"Manufacturing has declined in developed countries like the UK because many products are now being made in places abroad such as in India and China due to cheaper labor and production costs. This offshoring leads to factories closing down in the UK, causing a direct loss in secondary jobs. Additionally, as countries develop and individuals have more disposable income, there is a higher demand for services like education, events, and music. This growth in the tertiary sector diverts significant resources, including investment and skilled labor, away from the secondary sector, leading to its decline."
"Explain the formation of a flood plain",4,A flood plain is where floods go into a valley and move the sediment out of the river where it drops.
"Explain the formation of a flood plain",4,"In the middle and lower courses of a river, floods take sediment such as alluvium out of the channel where it is deposited. Over time this sediment builds up and creates a wide flat floodplain. Another factor is the erosion of the river through the river valley."
"Explain the formation of a flood plain",4,"In the middle and lower courses of a river, floods take sediment such as alluvium out of the channel where it is deposited. Over time this sediment builds up and creates a wide flat floodplain. Another factor is the erosion of the river through the river valley. The meandering process of a river as it moves side to side through the softer sedimentary rock and sediment deposits, carves a wide and flat valley either side of the river over time. Floodplains are often fertile due to nutrient rich deposits."
"Explain the formation of a flood plain",4,"Floodplains are created by the lateral erosion of river valleys. This sideways movement carves out a flat plain through a valley as the meanders migrate across over long periods of time. The other factor is the deposition of sediment. When a river floods, it leaves fine particles of alluvium behind when it runs out of energy, this builds up over time creating a consistent, wide and flat valley."
"Explain two ways that growth in tourism has had a negative impacts on rural environments (4)",4,One way is that it helps peoplem to get jobs meaning they have more money in the area. People with more money are happier and more content
"Explain two ways that growth in tourism has had a negative impacts on rural environments (4)",4,Two ways are that trampling of the ground at tourist sites wears away the soil and can impact animals habitats.
"Explain two ways that growth in tourism has had a negative impacts on rural environments (4)",4,Two ways are that trampling of the ground at tourist sites wears away the soil and can impact animals habitats. The second way is through deforestation because of building places for tourists to stay and eat etc. This tourist infrastructure means there is less land available for nature and wildlife.
"Explain two ways human activity has reduced water quality (4)",4,Humans burn fossil fuels which had co2 to the atmosphere and rivers
"Explain two ways human activity has reduced water quality (4)",4,"Humans create waste through sewage, some of this ends up being dumped into rivers where it makes the water poisonous to drink. They also create chemicals from farming which go in the river."
"Explain two ways human activity has reduced water quality (4)",4,"Humans farm and in this process create nitrogen fertilisers, these can end up being washed into the rivers and causing etrophication where algae blooms and suffocates the water, meaning that it doesn't get naturally cleaned by the plants within it, making the water less potable. They also throw their rubbish and litter into sources of water, this combined with industrial waste, causes huge amounts of micro plastics to end up in the water meaning that water quality is lowered."
"Explain the formation of a waterfall. (4)",4,A waterfall is caused by erosion of soft rock leaving hard rock on top
"Explain the formation of a waterfall. (4)",4,A waterfall is formed when a layer of hard rock forms an over layer of soft rock and the softer rock is eroded through processes such as abrasion and hydraulic action. This erosion makes a plunge pool and an overhang.
"Explain the formation of a waterfall. (4)",4,"A waterfall is formed when a layer of hard rock forms an over layer of soft rock and the softer rock is eroded through processes such as abrasion and hydraulic action. Hydraulic action is a key one as it involves the pressure of water forcing into the cracks in the rock, causing it to crumble and get washed away. Abrasion is where the rocks in the river wear away at the bottom and sides of the river. This erosion makes a plunge pool below where the water falls from a height. The Layer of hard rock over the top forms and overhang which can eventually give way under gravity and collapse. As this process repeats, a steep gorge can occur as the waterfall retreats into the valley."
"Explain the formation of a volcano (4)",4,Volcanoes are formed through movement of tectonic plates crashing into each other
"Explain the formation of a volcano (4)",4,"Volcanoes are created at a destructive plate boundary when two plates move towards each other. One goes under the other and melts, creating lava which bursts through the ground causing a volcano. They can also form at constructive boundaries"
"Explain the formation of a volcano (4)",4,"At a destructive plate boundary, two plates move towards each other. One subducts under the other and melts in the heat of the mantle, creating lava which bursts through the ground causing a volcano. They can also form at constructive boundaries where two plates move apart from each other. The creation of these rift valleys can then cause magma from under the surface to bubble up and cause volcanoes."
"Study Figure 2a in the Resource Booklet (one picture showing beach replenishment and one picture showing rock armour and sea walls). Suggest one reason for each of these different approaches to coastal management.",4,Adding sand to the beach is good because it makes it erode less. Hard engineering is good.
"Study Figure 2a in the Resource Booklet (one picture showing beach replenishment and one picture showing rock armour and sea walls). Suggest one reason for each of these different approaches to coastal management.",4,Hard engineering approaches like rock armour help to reduce erosion and so are very effective at stopping oncoming waves.
"Study Figure 2a in the Resource Booklet (one picture showing beach replenishment and one picture showing rock armour and sea walls). Suggest one reason for each of these different approaches to coastal management.",4,"The soft engineering approaches like beach replenishment shown in the figure are used because they support tourism, allowing people to continue using the beach and the economy of the area to grow. Hard engineering approaches like the rock armour and sea walls shown in the figure limit the effect of erosion by absorbing the wave energy meaning that the coast is effectively protected."
"For a named developed country, explain two ways that energy resources are being managed in a sustainable way. (4)",4,"In the Iceland, they are using the geothermal energy"
"For a named developed country, explain two ways that energy resources are being managed in a sustainable way. (4)",4,In the UK they are using their wind energy from the wind in the atmosphere. It lasts forever and won’t run out so it is sustainable. They have other renewables too.
"For a named developed country, explain two ways that energy resources are being managed in a sustainable way. (4)",4,In Iceland they are utilising their geothermal energy supplied from their underground sources. The heat from the magma doesn’t require any additional energy and can be taken without carbon emissions so is very sustainable. Another thing they are doing is improving the energy efficiency of their housing by investing in double glazing and new boilers which mean that less energy has to be used in the homes.
"Explain two reasons why developed countries have a declining secondary sector. (4)",4,"One reason is that secondary sectors are the ones where stuff is made, it is declining because less stuff is being made there."
"Explain two reasons why developed countries have a declining secondary sector. (4)",4,"Manufacturing has gotten less because developed countries like the UK don’t make as many products because they are now being made in places abroad such as in India and China where it is cheaper.

"Explain two reasons why developed countries have a declining secondary sector. (4)",4,"Manufacturing has gotten less because developed countries like the UK don’t make as many products because they are now being made in places abroad such as in India and China where it is cheaper. Because it is cheaper, factories close and secondary jobs are lost. Another reason is that as people have more money as a country develops, they can spend it on other things such services like education, events and music which means there are more jobs, an increase in the tertiary sector might lead to resources (like investment, skilled labour, etc.) being diverted away from the secondary sector"
"Explain two reasons why developed countries have a declining secondary sector. (4)",4,Businesses move manufacturing overseas due to cheaper labour costs. This creates a deficit in the number of manufacturing secondary jobs as factories close.The improvement of automation and technology reduces the need for human workers in manufacturing. This leads to a decline in jobs available as robots remove the need for humans to do them.
"Explain two ways rural-urban migration affects rural areas. (4)",4,Rural areas become more overcrowded causing people economic problems because of agricultural productivity
"Explain two ways rural-urban migration affects rural areas. (4)",4,Rural areas become overcrowded
"Explain two ways rural-urban migration affects rural areas. (4)",4,"Rural areas lose some of their population and so end up with certain sectors of their economy getting worse, especially if young people leave meaning there are less people working and earning money and paying taxes."
"Explain two ways rural-urban migration affects rural areas. (4)",4,"One issue is rural depopulation caused by emigration, this can have huge impacts on the economy of a place as there aren’t enough people to do all the jobs so places suffer economically. Another issue is that cultural erosion can take place as people leave, meaning that traditional food, dances and ceremonies may be lost and may never be rediscovered."
"Explain two ways rural-urban migration affects rural areas. (4)",4,"One issue is that land can be lost due to people leaving and abandoning land. This is an environmental issue as there is now no one sherperding or looking after the land and it might go to pot. Another issue is a decline in services such as schools and buses as demand declines. People leave the area, so the ones who are left get less opportunities."
"Study Figure 7c in the Resource Booklet (a graph showing the increase in rates of climate based disasters between 1980- and 2011 including floods, droughts, storms and extreme temperatures. Assess the effects of climate change on fragile environments. (6)",6,Higher temperatures cause areas to get desertified. This is because the heat makes the ground dry up.
"Study Figure 7c in the Resource Booklet (a graph showing the increase in rates of climate based disasters between 1980- and 2011 including floods, droughts, storms and extreme temperatures. Assess the effects of climate change on fragile environments. (6)",6,"Soil erosion may increase as a result of climate change, for example it cause soil to dry out, wind and droughts to increase. Soil erosion could be in the form of gully and sheet erosion with more intense precipitation events, which are associated with climate change. Desertification may increase as productive land becomes degraded by drought, extreme temperatures, unreliable rainfall, further increasing the fragility of the ecosystem. Rising sea levels may threaten/flood low-lying coastal ecosystems and fragile environments. This is something that could be further exacerbated by more frequent storms/hurricanes due to warmer ocean temperatures. Increasing risk of fragile environments being affected by flooding as a result of glacial melting, flash floods and baked/impermeable soils."
"Study Figure 7c in the Resource Booklet (a graph showing the increase in rates of climate based disasters between 1980- and 2011 including floods, droughts, storms and extreme temperatures. Assess the effects of climate change on fragile environments. (6)",6,"Figure 7c shows an overall increase in all types of climate disasters, apart from drought. Figure 7c shows that the most significant rises have been in storms and floods: up to 100 storms and around 50–200 floods per year. These can have drastic effects on areas particularly those near the coast as rising sea levels can threaten towns and cities and mean that people have economic damage and may have to move house and become climate refugees. Droughts and extreme temperatures show some variability per year but storms and floods show much higher variability. Droughts and extreme temperatures can cause desertification which dries up the soil and makes agricultural land unproductive. This means that people can’t grow crops, feed themselves or make a living in these areas. An example of this is in the Sahel region where the desertification has cost many lives. Figure 7c indicates that there is only a moderate increase in extreme temperatures over the 1980–2011 period."
"Study Figure 9b in the Resource Booklet (showing a choropleth map of global hunger index as a measure of food security). Assess the importance of food security to global patterns of economic development.",6,"From the map, we can see that some countries have a high hunger index which means they might not have enough food for everyone. When a country doesn't have food security, its people might be too weak or sick to work, leading to less development. Therefore, having enough food is important for a country's economy"
"Study Figure 9b in the Resource Booklet (showing a choropleth map of global hunger index as a measure of food security). Assess the importance of food security to global patterns of economic development.",6,"Based on Figure 9b, there's a clear link between a country's food security, as measured by the global hunger index, and its economic development. Countries with a higher hunger index often struggle with providing basic needs for their citizens, which can lead to challenges like malnutrition, lower productivity, and higher healthcare costs. On the other hand, countries with good food security have a foundation for a healthy workforce, enabling them to focus on more advanced economic activities and infrastructure. Thus, ensuring food security is not just about meeting a basic human need but also pivotal for a nation's overall economic growth and progress."

"Assess the importance of managing transport as part of urban sustainability(AQA)",6,You can walk instead of taking the car and places have buses and tubes instead of cars which is better for the environment.
"Assess the importance of managing transport as part of urban sustainability(AQA)",6,"It is very important to manage transport as traffic congestion can be detrimental for peoples long term health and the sustainability of the city. When cars take up the roads, they cause people to be late for work, and to get annoyed meaning that productivity decreases and the emissions from cars cause health problems. Also envirionmentally, without a strategy, co2 emissions contribute to climate change and can have very bad long term sustainability issues."
"Assess the importance of managing transport as part of urban sustainability(AQA)",6,"You can do things like investing in buses and public transport instead of driving. They can also create roads that are one way at peaks times, meaning that there is less traffic congestion. They can also have boris bikes and transport that doesnt release co2. Also they can do electric cars to stop emissions and encourage people to walk instead of drive."
"Assess the importance of managing transport as part of urban sustainability(AQA)",6,"Managing transport is important in the UK where they have created boris bikes which are very cheap and better for the environment. As they dont release emissions of co2 they are good for the air quality and dont contribute to climate change, therefore they are important for sustainability. In the UK we also invest in buses, and there is a new thing where buses are cheap for getting two instead of paying twice. This is good for sustainability because if people take buses they dont take cars, meaning that there is less co2 released."

This is very good for sustainability as when cars take up the roads, they cause people to be late for work, and to get annoyed meaning that productivity decreases and the emissions from cars cause health problems. Also environmentally, without a strategy, emissions of particulate matter can cause long term health problems, so for a sustainable urban plan this needs to be reduced. In curitiba, Brazil, they have improved the congestion by putting in dedicated bus lanes to do this."
"Explain the formation of physical landforms of erosion at the coast.(AQA)",6,One landform of erosion is beaches. They form when sand builds up on the coast where there is less wave energy. There are also spits and tombolos which are created by longshore drift moving sediment along a coastline.
"Explain the formation of physical landforms of erosion at the coast.(AQA)",6,Wave cut platforms can be caused by erosion taking away material underneath the cliff and making it fall down. This happens again and again until the flat platform is left. Erosion is like abrasion
"Explain the formation of physical landforms of erosion at the coast.(AQA)",6,"Erosion includes hydraulic action where the water pressure gets trapped in rocks and forces its way in in, cracking the rock apart. Also abrasion where the material in the water wears away the rocks through a manual process, chipping away and causing the rocks to erode. These process can cause holes in the cliffs to occur which are called caves. Over time these caves can open all the way through a headland to the other side creating a arch. If this arch collapses it leaves behind a stack, which is eventually eroded away further and can leave a stump after many years."
"Explain how physical and human factors may affect flood risk(6)",6,Humans can impact flooding by doing more damage to the environment and make it all bad so that people get flooded.
"Explain how physical and human factors may affect flood risk(6)",6,"Human factors like the amount of rainfall are the biggest, lots of rainfall means lots of water in the river."
"Explain how physical and human factors may affect flood risk(6)",6,"Steep slopes, high rainfall, impermeable surfaces, deforestation and compacted clay soils cause floods."
"Explain how physical and human factors may affect flood risk(6)",6,"An example is at boscastle where there were steep slopes and heavy rainfall, two physical factors which combined to cause a big flood. It is then made worse by things like deforestation which make the run off more."
"Explain how physical and human factors may affect flood risk(6)",6,"Physical factors include the steepness of slopes, the higher the gradient, the quicker water travels into the channel and so there is a higher chance of a flood occurring. Another physical factor is the material of the ground, more permeable surfaces such as soil will allow water to infiltrate through and so take longer to get into the river. This will mean less chance of a flood occurring. This is linked to a human factor, which is the building of impermeable surfaces such as roads and buildings, these mean the water goes into the rivers very fast meaning more chance of floods as the river can get overwhelmed. An obvious physical factor is heavy rainfall as more rainfall in a shorter time means the discharge in the river is very high and has a greater chance of flooding the banks"

However some human factors can have a positive impact like building flood prevention barriers and levees which can reduce the chances of flooding by keeping water in the river."
